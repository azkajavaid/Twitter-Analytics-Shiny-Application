### Twitter Analytics Shiny Application 

Twitter analytics shiny application, accessible at https://aj17.shinyapps.io/twitteranalytics/, assesses a user's twitter use across time metrics like hour, weekday, month and year and platform metrics like Instagram, iPhone and Twitter Web Client. This app also facilitates word cloud, topic modeling, sentiment, text and emoji anaysis of a user's live tweets along with a mapped geographic and network analysis of that user's followings/followers.

In addition to a user's live tweet analysis, this app can assess analogous metrics, including geographic level trend analysis, on a twitter hashtag/topic.
